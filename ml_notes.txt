1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Core idea:
Instead of writing rules → we let the model learn rules from data.

Mathematical view:
ML finds a function f(x) that maps input x to output y by minimizing error.

2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning
2.1 Supervised Learning

Data has input + correct output (labels)

Goal: Learn mapping from X → Y

Examples:

Email spam detection

House price prediction

Disease diagnosis

Main tasks:

Classification → Predict category (Spam / Not Spam)

Regression → Predict continuous value (Price, Salary)

2.2 Unsupervised Learning

Data has no labels

Goal: Discover hidden structure

Examples:

Customer segmentation

Topic modeling

Anomaly detection

Main tasks:

Clustering (grouping)

Dimensionality reduction

2.3 Semi-Supervised Learning

Small labeled data + large unlabeled data

Used when labeling is expensive

2.4 Reinforcement Learning

Agent learns by trial and error

Uses reward and punishment

Core elements:

Agent

Environment

Action

Reward

Policy

3️⃣ Machine Learning Workflow (End-to-End)

Problem definition

Data collection

Data cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model selection

Training

Evaluation

Hyperparameter tuning

Deployment

Monitoring & retraining

4️⃣ Data Types in ML
4.1 Structured Data

Rows & columns

Example: CSV, SQL tables

4.2 Unstructured Data

Text, images, audio, video

4.3 Semi-Structured Data

JSON, XML, logs

5️⃣ Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of creating meaningful inputs for ML models.

Techniques:

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Creating interaction features

Date/time extraction

Text vectorization

Why it matters:
Better features > better models.

6️⃣ Feature Scaling
6.1 Standardization
(x - mean) / std

6.2 Normalization
(x - min) / (max - min)


Required for:

KNN

SVM

Neural Networks

K-Means

7️⃣ Train, Validation, Test Split

Training set → Learn

Validation set → Tune

Test set → Final evaluation

Typical splits:

70 / 15 / 15

80 / 20

8️⃣ Overfitting vs Underfitting
Overfitting

Model learns noise

High train accuracy, low test accuracy

Underfitting

Model too simple

Poor performance everywhere

Solution:

Regularization

More data

Better features

Proper model complexity

9️⃣ Bias–Variance Tradeoff

High Bias → Underfitting

High Variance → Overfitting

Goal: Balance both.
